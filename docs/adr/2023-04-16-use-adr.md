# Use ADR (Architectural Decision Records)

## Status

<!-- What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.? -->
accepted

## Context

<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change. -->
Decision making is hard. We need to make decisions and document them. We need to be able to look back at the decisions we made and understand why we made them.

## Decision

<!-- What is the change that we're actually proposing or doing. -->
We will use ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) to document our decisions. We will use the simple ADR format described in [Michael Nygard's blog post](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

### Considered Options

- Design Docs
- RFCs

## Consequences

<!-- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? -->
