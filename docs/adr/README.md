# Architectural Decision Records

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are a lightweight way to capture architectural decisions, particularly those that need to be communicated to people outside the development team. They are a form of lightweight documentation of an architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Why ADRs?

ADRs are a way to record the rationale behind architectural decisions made on a project. They are lightweight and easy to create, and they provide a standard way for a team to record and communicate decisions.

## How to create an ADR

```sh
pnpm new:adr
```
